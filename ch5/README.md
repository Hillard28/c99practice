# SELECTION STATEMENTS
- Aside from return and expression statements, the remainder of C's statements fall into three categories:
  1) Selection statements: the `if` and `switch` statements allow a program to select a particular execution path from a set of alternatives.
  2) Iteration statements: the `while`, `do`, and `for` statements support iteration (looping).
  3) Jump statements: the `break`, `continue`, and `goto` statements cause an unconditional jump to some other place in the program (the `return` statement is a jump statement as well).
- The only other statements in C are the compound statement, which groups several statements into a single statement, and the null statement, which performs no action.
